      <h2>A Front End Web Developer.</h2>
      <p>
        I began my coding journey two years ago when I decided to teach myself
        web development. I&apos;ve always been passionate about creativity and
        problem-solving, and I wanted to incorporate that into my career.
      </p>
      <p>
        After completing a full-stack web developer bootcamp, I learned that I
        had a penchant for front-end technologies. I&apos;m furthering my
        education by learning React and polishing my front-end skills. My vision
        for my career is to utilize these skills to support missions in climate
        technology and web accessibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being a self-taught developer is my biggest strength, as I&apos;ve
        facilitated my own learning outside of the traditional path and have
        strengthened many core values in doing so. I look forward to pursuing my
        degree once I&apos;m established in my field to further my opportunity.
