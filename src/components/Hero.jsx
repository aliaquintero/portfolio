      <p>
        I&apos;ve always been passionate about creativity and
        problem-solving, and I wanted to incorporate that into my career. I learned that I
        had a penchant for front-end technologies.  My vision
        for my career is to utilize these skills to support missions in climate
        technology and web accessibility. Being a self-taught developer is my biggest strength, as I&apos;ve
        facilitated my own learning outside of the traditional path and have
        strengthened many core values in doing so.
